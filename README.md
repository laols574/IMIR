## Notes
Currently, this project is a rough draft, which renders without errors in both Android and IOS emulators; 
however, much content is missing and layout is faulty in areas.


## Included files

* Page*.xaml - XAML files which contain the formatting for app pages.
* Page*.xaml.c - XAML C sharp files which initialize the pages and handle events.
* Page*.c - C sharp files which contain the class declarations for the pages.
